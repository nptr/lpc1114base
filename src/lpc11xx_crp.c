 * different levels of security in the system so that access to the on-chip
 * flash and use of the ISP can be restricted.

/* Access to chip via the SWD pins is disabled. This mode allows partial
 * flash update using the following ISP commands and restrictions:
    - Write to RAM command should not access RAM below 0x1000
     0300. Access to addresses below 0x1000 0200 is disabled.
    - Copy RAM to flash command can not write to Sector 0.
    - Erase command can erase Sector 0 only when all sectors are
     selected for erase.
    - Compare command is disabled.
    - Read Memory command is disabled.
 * This mode is useful when CRP is required and flash field updates are
 * needed but all sectors can not be erased. Since compare command
 * is disabled in case of partial updates the secondary loader should
 * implement checksum mechanism to verify the integrity of the flash.

 * CAUTION: IF CRP3 IS SELECTED, NO FUTURE FACTORY TESTING CAN BE
 * PERFORMED ON THE DEVICE.
